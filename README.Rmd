# cehAforos

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cehAforos is to allow users to easily download datasets for gauging stations in Spanish rivers. The datasets are available at the [CEDEX web site](https://ceh.cedex.es/anuarioaforos/demarcaciones.asp). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of cehAforos from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install_it}
# install.packages("githubinstall")
# githubinstall::gh_install_packages("cehAforos", "devel")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to download daily data from river gauging stations for the Ebro basin:

```{r example1}
# Use verbose = TRUE (default) if you want to track progress.
x <- get_ceh_data(file_name = "afliq", basin_nam = "ebro", verbose = FALSE)
```

<br>

We can retrieve as easily the same datasets for all stations and from all the basins by omitting the $\tt{basin}$ parameter.

```{r example2}
# x <- read_cedex_basin(table = "afliq", verbose = FALSE)
```
